 SQL Project: Orders, Books & Customers Analysis
This project is all about using SQL to explore and analyze three related datasets: Orders, Books, and Customers.

The Orders dataset tracks purchases, including when they were made and which customer bought which book.

The Books dataset has details about each book — like the title, author, genre, and price.

The Customers dataset includes basic information about each customer, such as their name, location, and contact info.

Using SQL, the project dives into these datasets to answer real-world questions — like which books are selling the most, where customers are located, and what kind of trends we can spot in the sales data.
